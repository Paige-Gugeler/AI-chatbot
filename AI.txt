 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that aims to make machines behave the way humans do.

Narrow AI have intelligent systems that have learned how to accomplish specific tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so.

General AI is the concept of one AI machine being able to carry out multiple tasks like a human can. General AI however, is still just seen in movies and not the real world. Despite that, many advances are being made to make this a reality.

Machine learning gives computers the opportunity to learn without being explicitly programmed, by using provided data to teach themselves. 

Deep learning is  where the computer goes in-depth on one specific feature. 

Neural networks consist of several layers that each process information like a human nervous system.

Some applications of AI include transportation, healthcare, finance, exploration, personal service, and entertainment.
